# quicksort:

Quicksort Algo:

1. Given an unsorted array of numbers
2. Find the correct location of the number on the left index such that all smaller numbers in the list will be to the left and bigger numbers on the right
3. Step 2 gives two sublists - one to the left of the correctly placed number and the other to the right
4. Repeat step (2) for each of the sublists in step (3)
5. Once step (4) ends entire array will be sorted from smallest number to biggest
